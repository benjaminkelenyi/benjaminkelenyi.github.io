I’m Benjamin Kelényi, a Software Engineer with a PhD in Systems Engineering, passionate about embedded programming, artificial intelligence, and innovative problem solving. I specialize in firmware development, embedded systems, and AI-driven perception for resource-constrained platforms. My professional focus is on developing reliable and efficient solutions across firmware, drivers, and real-time operating systems.

My experience spans across embedded software, computer vision research, and automotive systems, including former roles in image processing, AI model development, and C/C++ development for ECU systems.  

I hold a PhD focused on efficient perception for mobile robots, where I explored AI, 3D vision, and embedded intelligence. I’ve authored several research papers on deep learning, computer vision, and Time-of-Flight imaging techniques.

I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to build meaningful technology. Beyond engineering, I enjoy sports, fitness, traveling, and constantly exploring new challenges in both tech and life.
